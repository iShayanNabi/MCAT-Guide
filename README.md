## Study Resources

To achieve success on the MCAT, I will leverage a variety of study materials specifically tailored to my computer science background. These resources will help me gain the necessary knowledge and skills for the exam:

- **[Khan Academy MCAT](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat)**: Khan Academy offers free MCAT preparation resources, including video lectures and practice questions, suitable for individuals with various academic backgrounds.

- **[Kaplan MCAT Review Books](https://www.kaptest.com/mcat)**: Kaplan's MCAT review books are designed to be accessible to students from different backgrounds, providing comprehensive content coverage and practice.

- **[Anki Flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)**: Anki is a popular flashcard application that I'll use to create personalized flashcards for MCAT concepts and definitions.

Apologies for the cutoff. Let me continue with the rest of the README.md document:

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to have access to my MCAT study plan and resources.
2. Customize the study plan according to my individual preferences and needs, considering my computer science background.
3. Gather all study resources, including Khan Academy, Kaplan review books, and Anki flashcards.
4. Set up a dedicated study space and establish a study schedule that balances preparation and rest.

## Tracking Progress

To monitor my progress effectively, I'll use a progress tracker spreadsheet to record daily study hours, practice exam scores, and areas of improvement. This will help me identify trends, adjust my study plan, and celebrate milestones along the way.

Here's the link to the [MCAT Progress Tracker Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/your-progress-tracker-link/edit). Feel free to make a copy and customize it for your own use.

I'll update the progress tracker regularly to ensure that I am on track to meet my study goals and assess my readiness for the MCAT.

## Contributing

As this is a personal study plan, contributions are not expected. However, if you have suggestions for improvement or resources that may benefit individuals with a computer science background, feel free to create an issue or reach out to me.
